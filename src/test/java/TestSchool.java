/*


Course objects function as placeholders for the name of the course, the start date and end date of the course.

You can add a course to the school.

The end date should be after the begin date, otherwise a CourseException is thrown.

The name of the course is unique.

You can get a course by name.

You can get a list of all course names.

You can get a list of copies of all courses

Course begin dates are after the school begin date. Throw a CourseException when it’s wrong.
